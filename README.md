## About <a name = "about"></a>

Since MS Teams doesn't support mutiple people sharing their screens and nobody really wants to just use a webcam to share their face or are conserned about recording the call if they do. We should instead use free and open source tool [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). There are many other software that are capble of doing "virtual webcam" just google this term if obs doesn't work or you want to use something else.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started you first will need to go download: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).
